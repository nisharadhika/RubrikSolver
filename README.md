# RubikSolver

RubikSolver is an AI-assisted Rubik's Cube Scanner & Solver built using Java and OpenCV.  
It detects cube face colors from camera images and solves the cube logically.

## Features

- 3D cube model representation.
- Color detection from cube images (stub for OpenCV provided).
- Solver algorithm (stub for Kociemba or any algorithm).
- Modular design: model, vision, solver.

## Technologies

- Java 17+
- OpenCV 4.x
- Maven

## Structure

- model → Cube model
- vision → Image scanner + color detector
- solver → Solves the cube
